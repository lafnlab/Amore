## *Amore* and i18n/l10n/g11n

*Amore* is being created with multilingualism in mind. Strings in the interface are coded so they can be read by gettext. In turn, gettext is used to create the amore.pot file, which is a template file for creating localized versions in different languages and dialects.

The default locale is American English (en_US), but the site administrator can change this whenever they choose. Since *Amore* is still at the alpha stage, only a limited number of locales are currently available. These are:

* Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR)
* British English (en_GB)
* French (fr_FR)
* German (de_DE)
* Italian (it_IT)
* Japanese (ja_JP)
* Latin American Spanish (es_419)
* Ukrainian (uk_UA)

* amore.fr@dating.media French translation
* amore.it@dating.media Italian translation
* amore.ja@dating.media Japanese translation
* amore.pt@dating.media Portuguese translation

Other locales will be added in the future, as coding on *Amore* progresses through newer releases. Since these translations are made using Google Translate, they are bound to miss linguistic nuances, so any help is appreciated.
