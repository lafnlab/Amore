# Amore

*Amore* requires you to do some setup to get it working.

### Setup the database
This software presumes you know your way around MySQL and/or MariaDB. Create a new database for Amore to use. The database can have any name you want to give it. After creating the DB, use `sql\setup.sql` to create the tables and enter some initial information.

### conn.php
After you've setup the database, you'll need to enter the pertinent information in the `conn.php` file. If this information isn't entered, the software will not work.
