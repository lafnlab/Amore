# **Amore** v0.3 Administrator's manual

This Administrator's Manual for **Amore** v0.3 is meant to provide information on how to perform administrative tasks in the software. This manual is intended for use with version 0.3 of **Amore** and may not be appropriate for other versions.

### Configuration

After installing **Amore**, it's recommended that the administrator take some time configuring the website to make it more useful and usable. The configuration has been divided into three areas: general, home page, and privacy.

##### General
The general configuration webpage has some settings that should be configured first.

+ The *Site name* field should already be filled in, while the rest of the fields are blank, have placeholder text, or have some default data.
+ The *URL* field has some placeholder text that needs to be replaced with the actual URL of the website. Some links may not work without it.
+ The *Description* field also has some placeholder text. It's highly suggested that this be filled out with unique description of the website. It can influence how the website appears in search engines.
+ The *Default locale* is currently set to `en-US`, which is the only locale currently available.
+ The *Membership* checkbox is important. If it is unchecked, nobody can register on their own, but would need to have their accounts created by an administrator. For security reasons it is left unchecked, but whenever the website is up-and-running well it is strongly suggested that this be checked so people can join.
+ The *Admin account* field is probably blank. This isn't currently used in **Amore**, so it is safe to leave empty.
+ The *Admin email* field is also probably blank. It also isn't used by **Amore** at the moment, so it is safe to leave blank.
+ The *Post is called* field is blank. **Amore** uses it on the statistics page, so if you would like it to refer to a *post* as something else, enter it here.
+ The *Posts are called* field is blank. **Amore** uses it on the statistics page, so if you would like it to refer to *posts* as something else, enter it here.
+ The *Repost is called* field is blank. **Amore** uses it on the statistics page, so if you would like it to refer to a *repost* as something else, enter it here.
+ The *Reposts are called* field is blank. **Amore** uses it on the statistics page, so if you would like it to refer to *reposts* as something else, enter it here.
+ The *Favorite is called* field is blank. **Amore** uses it with the posts, so if you would like it to refer to a *favorite* as something else, enter it here.
+ The *Favorites are called* field is blank. **Amore** uses it with the posts, so if you would like it to refer to *favorites* as something else, enter it here.
+ The *Dislike is called* field is blank. **Amore** uses it with the posts, so if you would like it to refer to a *dislike* as something else, enter it here.
+ The *Dislikes are called* field is blank. **Amore** uses it with the posts, so if you would like it to refer to *dislikes* as something else, enter it here.
+ The *User is called* field is blank. **Amore** uses it on the statistics page, so if you would like it to refer to a *user* as something else, enter it here.
+ The *Users are called* field is blank. **Amore** uses it on the statistics page, so if you would like it to refer to *users* as something else, enter it here.
+ The *Maximum characters per post* field is set to 500 by default. This isn't currently used, so it can be blank, left as the default, or set to something else.

When the fields are set as desired, click on the Update button. They can always be changed later if needed.

##### Home Page
The home page configuration webpage is intended to allow the site admin to decide what items would appear on the website's home page. These settings don't currently work, but they will in future versions of **Amore**.

##### Privacy
The privacy configuration webpage is intended to allow the site admin to decide if users can set privacy settings for some parts of their profiles. These settings don't currently work, but they will in future versions. of **Amore**.
