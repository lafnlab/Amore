# Amore

*Amore* is intended to be a dating and social media application that allows users to connect with users on other [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) nodes. It is written in PHP 7 for use with MySQL or MariaDB.

### WORD OF WARNING!
*Amore* is alpha software written by a hobbyist programmer with a tenuous of programming concepts and languages. *Caveat emptor.* It will probably never amount to much. If you plan on downloading it, don't use it on a production website. Don't invest money in it (unless you're giving the author enough money to quit his job and work on this full-time).
