# Amore

*Amore* is intended to be a dating and social media application that allows users to connect with users on other [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) nodes. It is written in PHP 7 for use with MySQL or MariaDB.

### WORD OF WARNING!
*Amore* is alpha software written by a hobbyist programmer with a tenuous grasp of programming concepts and languages. *Caveat emptor.* It will probably never amount to much. If you plan on downloading it, don't use it on a production website. Don't invest money in it (unless you're giving the author enough money to quit his job and work on this full-time). Feel free to dissect it, suggest changes, set it on fire, douse it with water, and throw it into a dimensional portal.

If you insist on trying out *Amore*, you should use one of the releases. Grabbing code willy-nilly is likely to result in a website that doesn't work, and nobody wants that.
