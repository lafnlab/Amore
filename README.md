# Amore
*Amore* ~~is~~ will be &ast;AMP dating app software for the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).

**Requires**
+ PHP 7.2
+ MySQL or MariaDB

**Suggested**
+ PHPMyAdmin (will make your life easier)
+ nginx web server

The goal for version 1.0 of *Amore* is to be as easy to install and configure as WordPress; to have the microblogging, social media, and Fediverse features of Mastodon, GnuSocial, and others; to have personal profile features similar to those found on numerous dating sites and apps; and to have an Android companion app. *Amore* will primarily be software for websites, but the importance of mobile apps is undeniable. An iOS app will follow, but somewhere between v 1.0 and v 1.5.
