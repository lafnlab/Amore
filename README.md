# Amore

![Amore favicon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lafnlab/Amore/master/pub/favicon.ico) *Amore* ~~is~~ will be open source dating app software for the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse). It is written in PHP 7.&ast; and uses MariaDB/MySQL for the database.

The current version of *Amore* is version 0.3 and is in early-beta status. This means it's missing a lot of features, and may not work as expected. However, early-adopters are welcome to try it out.

The goal for version 1.0 of *Amore* is to be as easy to install and configure as WordPress; to have the microblogging, social media, and Fediverse features of Mastodon, GnuSocial, and others; to have personal profile features similar to those found on numerous dating sites and apps; and to have an Android companion app. *Amore* will primarily be software for websites, but the importance of mobile apps is undeniable. An iOS app will follow, but somewhere between v 1.0 and v 1.5.

### Documentation
The [documentation](docs/README.md) for *Amore* is split into two sections: admin and reference. The admin documentation is intended for people who want to setup and run an instance of *Amore*, while the reference documentation is intended for those who are interested in *Amore* development.

### License
*Amore* is open-source software and is released under the [Apache License, version 2.0](LICENSE).
